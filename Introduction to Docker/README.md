## Overview
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. With Docker, you can separate your applications from your infrastructure and treat your infrastructure like a managed application. Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.

Docker does this by combining kernel containerization features with workflows and tooling that helps you manage and deploy your applications.

Docker containers can be directly used in Kubernetes, which allows them to be run in the Kubernetes Engine with ease. After learning the essentials of Docker, you will have the skillset to start developing Kubernetes and containerized applications.

## Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to:

- Build, run, and debug Docker containers.
- Pull Docker images from Docker Hub and Google Artifact Registry.
- Push Docker images to Google Artifact Registry.

### Prerequisites
This is an introductory level lab. Little to no prior experience with Docker and containers is assumed. Familiarity with Cloud Shell and the command line is suggested, but not required.

## Task 1. Hello world
## Task 2. Build
